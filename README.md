Graduate Admission Prediction

Background

Admission of postgraduate students into various universities plays a significant role in the education sector of different countries in the world. India is not an exception as it is the universities that act as the center for research and innovation. This project will use the dataset from India to predict the chance of admission of graduate students into the university to pursue further studies while considering various factors such as letters of recommendation from the previous institution or previous undergraduate program in India.

Problem Statement

While admitting graduate students for different postgraduate academic programs, there are factors that affect the chances of admission. This project is interested in analyzing factors that come into consideration while admitting graduate students and how they affect the chance of admission.

Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
1. Download the project dataset from Kaggle.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to derive insights from the dataset and use visuals such as boxplots, line charts, and histograms for a clear understanding and precise presentation.
3. Model building and evaluation of the complexity using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and Python libraries like Sklearn.
4. Take screenshots of the visuals for the final presentation  o summarize the key findings of the analysis, along with clear and concise explanations.
